**ImMut** is a tool for automatic performance testing for image displaying in Android apps. Given a functional test case, ImMut mutates it towards a performance test case by either (1) injecting external-source images with large ones or (2) copy-pasting a repeatable fragment and slightly mutating the copies to display many (potentially distinct) images.
